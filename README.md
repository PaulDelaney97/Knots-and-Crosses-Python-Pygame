# Knots-and-Crosses

This is my attempt at at a knots and crosses/tic-tac-toe game. I followed a tutorial on how to code a connect four game using pygame. I then worked on this very simple, and far from optimal, version of knots and crosses. 

First I implemented the game in the cmd line. My original game involed placing 1's and 2's in a 3x3 matrix. Using pygame, I have extended this cmd line game to a GUI game requiring user input. 

This is one of the my first projects using python. I enjoyed coding this small brute-force application, and I am looking forward to taking on larger, more complex, projects in the future.
